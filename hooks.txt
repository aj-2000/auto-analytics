1. useState
    state->access(no rerender)->set(rerender),
2. useReducer
    alternative of useState -> require a reducer fuction that uses SWITCH patter->dispath fuction is used to call methods,
3. useRef
    use to manipulate DOM directly -> implements vanillaJS solns -> we can access different properties of DOM element,
4. useEffect
    used to load data from API,
    run after rendering of UI element
5. useLayoutEffect
    almost identical to useEffect,
    run before rendering of UI element
6. useImperativeHandle
    use to change state of child element using parent element -> useRef is used -> forwardRef
7. useContext
    use states(context) created in parent element without passing states through props 
8. useMemo
    store the values return from a function and prevents recalling of fucntions
9. useCallback
    prevents recreation of function to improve perfomances
